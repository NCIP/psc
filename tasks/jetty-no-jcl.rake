# Remove the slf4j commons-logging adapter from the build classpath.
# When it is present, JCL loggers get bound to the simple logger used
# by jetty itself, making it impossible to get to DEBUG-level logging

# It would be nice to patch buildr to allow this more cleanly, but I'm
# not sure how. -- RMS20090213
