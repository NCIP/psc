Patient Study Calendar
======================

This is the source for Patient Study Calendar, an open source web application
for tracking patients on clinical trials. It is a Java Servlet application using
the Spring Framework and Hibernate for its major infrastructure. Its goal is to
help ensure that complex protocols are followed identically for different
patients. It can also help decouple protocol-dependent participant scheduling
information from more generic registration and consenting workflows.
