cas.trustStore.name=Trust store
cas.trustStore.description=The local filesystem path to a JKS keystore containing the CAS service's trusted certificate.  Necessary if the CAS service's certificate is not signed by a trusted CA.  Changes to this configuration element will require a server restart to take effect.

If this is enabled, PSC will accept user credentials (in the API only) and pass them on to the CAS server, bypassing the normal CAS protocol.  This is neccessary to support ICS subscriptions from third-party applications (e.g., Outlook or iCal) when using CAS for authentication.

psc.url.description=The canonical base URL for this PSC instance &mdash; for example, https://psc.institution.org/ or http://10.0.9.8/psc.  This is used to construct the CAS entry point URL for this instance.
