        <p>
            Thank you for testing the Patient Study Calendar.
            The software you are about to test is the second construction release.
            Your feedback will help guide our development efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
            Two considerations before you begin:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>This is a public instance. You may encounter
                sample study calendars created by other users.
                Other users will be able to see data that you
                enter. Please do not enter any confidential
                information.
            </li>
            <li>With each release, we may delete information
                from our database in order to prevent the site
                from getting cluttered with incomplete templates
                and abandoned calendars.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="demo-link">
            Let the testing begin: <a
            href="pages/redirectToDashboard" target="_blank">Public
            Test Site - start
            page</a>
        </p>

        <h2>To test the creation and management of study
            templates:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Login using <kbd>superuser</kbd> as both the
                username and password.
            </li>
            <li>Click the "Calendars" tab and "Create a new template" to begin the
                process of creating a new study template.
            </li>
            <li>You will be presented with a blank study. Using
                the on-screen buttons, rename the study, add and
                rename epochs, and add arms.
            </li>
            <li>You can also reorder the epochs and arms.</li>
            <li>When you click on an arm, you can add periods of
                time to that arm. You can then select the
                periods to add activities.
            </li>
            <li>Click "Mark this template as complete" when you
                have finished creating the template.
            </li>
            <li>Because a template must be associated with a
                site before participants can be added, find your
                template in the list of completed templates and
                click the "Assign Sites" link next to the
                template. Assign a Site to your template.
            </li>
            <li>You can click on your template in the list of
                "Completed Templates" and then click "Assign
                Participants" within the Template view.
            </li>
            <li>To test amending a template, click "Add amendment" and follow the instructions.  Amending the template allows the same basic set of actions as initially creating the template.  
            </li>
            <li>Please send feedback to <a
                href="mailto:s-whitaker@northwestern.edu">s-whitaker@northwestern.edu</a>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>To test the creation and management of participant
            calendars:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Find a template that is listed under "Completed
                templates".
            </li>
            <li>If "Assign sites" is your only option, select
                that and assign access to the template to a
                site.
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, select "Assign participants" and
                follow the steps in order to generate a
                calendar.
            </li>
            <li>To view or manage calendars that already exist,
                simply click on the template and then select the
                patient's calendar from the list.
            </li>
            <li>Once inside a patient's calendar, try
                rescheduling, canceling, and marking activities
                as having occurred. These actions can be done
                individually or to groups of activities using
                the "Batch reschedule" option.
            </li>
            <li>Please send feedback to <a
                href="mailto:s-whitaker@northwestern.edu">s-whitaker@northwestern.edu</a>
            </li>
        </ol>

            <li>The user can mark events on the template as
                being conditional and supply the condition.
                These are then available to be scheduled on a
                patient's calendar.
            </li>
            <li>Activities added to a period are now

                template.

                checkboxes to select any number of activities
                and change their state or reschedule them.
            </li>
            <li>A new look and feel has been adopted to more
                closely match other applications within the CTMS
                Workspace.
            </li>
        </ol>
