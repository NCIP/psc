DA-Launcher Home Directory - Every OSGi-based Application that is run using DA-Launcher has a 
Home Directory where it's excutable files, configuration files, bundles and logs exist. These are 
home's sub directories:

./bin - Contains executable files that launch the OSGi application. This directory is obsolete 
when a DA-Launcher Application is embedded in another application (Web Application for example).

./bundles - Contains the bundles of which the application consists.

./config - Contains DA-Launcher's configuration files.

./osgi-framework - Contains JAR archives of the used OSGi Framework (e.g., JARs for Felix and Equinox).

./lib - Contains library files needed for the DA-Launcher to run. If you don't want to use the 
executables to run the application you can always type the following command:
"java -jar ./lib/da-launcher-1.1.0.jar"

./logs - Contains application's log files.

./runtime - Contains files that are generated at runtime by DA-Launcher. These are not intended 
to be modified by developers.
