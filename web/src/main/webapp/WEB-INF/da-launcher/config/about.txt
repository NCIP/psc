All DA-Launcher related configurations are placed in this directory. If the customization 
that you need can't be found in the files in this directory, then you will mostly have 
to extend DA-Launcher to implement it. Below are the configuration files:

./osgi-framework.xml - Configures the OSGi Framework that will be used by DA-Launcher 
to run the OSGi Environment.

./bundle-settings.xml - Bundle related configurations (e.g., automatically start installed 
bundles, igonre bundle starting errors, etc.)

./logging-settings.xml - DA-Launcher's Loggers settings.

./extensions.properties - Extensions for DA-Launcher related configuration.
