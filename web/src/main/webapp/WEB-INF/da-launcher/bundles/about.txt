This directory contains bundle files that the OSGi-based application consumes. Copying and removing 
bundle files at runtime installs and uninstalls their bundles. These are the subdirectories:

./application-bundles - Contains Applcation Bundles - The bundles that a typical 
OSGi-based application will consist of. These bundles provide the functionality of the
application.

./system-bundles - Contains System Bundles - These bundles usually provide infrastructural
services that are less related to the functionality of the application and more related to issues 
like bundle management, logging utilities, etc. System Bundles are installed and started before
Application Bundles. Examples of such bundles are: Spring Dynamic Modules bundles, OBR bundles, 
Logging Service bundles, etc. It's up to the developer to decide which bundles need to be placed
in the 'application-bundles' directory and which in the 'system-bundles' directory.

./non-bundled-libraries - Contains non-bundled libraries (OSGi incompliant JAR files - JAR files 
that don't contain OSGi headers). DA-Launcher will generate bundles from these libraries and export 
the packages they contain. The generated bundles will be started before Application and System Bundles.
