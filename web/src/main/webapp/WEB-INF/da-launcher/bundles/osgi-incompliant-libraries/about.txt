Contains osgi-incompliant libraries (JAR archives that don't
contain OSGi headers). DA-Launcher will generate bundles from these libraries and export the packages they contain.

Any bundle placed in this directory will maintain the original OSGi headers 
alongside some other OSGi headers generated by DA-Launcher.

DA-Launcher will auto-generate OSGi headers for osgi-incompliant libraries. If an auto-generated header 
doesn't meet your need, you can set a specific value for it by defining a file with in the same 
directory where the JAR file exists and has the same name as the JAR file but with the extension 
".properties". Any property in the properties file that has a name of OSGi headers prefixed with "header.", its value will be used for the OSGi header of the generated bundle. Below is an example of this feature:
If you have a class library named "stax-api.jar" and you would like to set different values for the 
"Export-Package" and "Import-Package" headers then what you need to do is the following:
1- Create a new file in the same directory as the "stax-api.jar" file but with the name "stax-api.properties".
2- Add the following two following lines to the file:
Export-Package= javax.xml.stream; javax.xml.stream.events; javax.xml.stream.util; version=2.0.0
Import-Package= javax.xml.stream; javax.xml.stream.events; javax.xml.stream.util; version=2.0.0

If you have a bundle archive and you would like the bundle to have other header values when installed in 
the OSGi Environment, you can use the same tecnique above to solve this issue.
