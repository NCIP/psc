This directory contains the JAR files for supported OSGi Frameworks. The JAR files 
should be grouped in directories first by Framework then by version. The Framework 
should have the value 'felix', 'equinox' or 'knopflerfish', the Version directory can have 
any valid directory name. So if you have version '3.3.0' of Equinox, you must create a directory 
with the name 'equinox' and create a sub directory with the version name, you could name 
it '3.3.0' (or any other suitable name for you like 'equinox-with-my-extensions'), then 
you need to place the JAR files in the Version directory - You can use as a reference 
the current included Frameworks. For the Framework to be used by your application you 
need to configure the file '/config/osgi-framework.xml'.
