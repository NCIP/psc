This module is a reimplementation of dynamicjava.org's api-bridge.  Differences:

- Optimized for passing the same objects back and forth across the membrane
  between the primary classloader and the OSGi environment.  Will create at
  most one proxy per object.
- Uses cglib 2.1.3 instead of 1.0 for compatibility with Hibernate & Spring.
- Better handling of classes from the bootstrap classloader.
- Bridging of thrown exceptions.
- More robust selection of superclasses for proxying (e.g., only select
  superclasses with a default constructor).
- More robust invocation of delegate methods -- invokes the method from the
  implemented interface instead of from the class directly where possible.
  This allows compatibility with, e.g., private inner classes.
- Support for proxying the contents of java.util.Collections.
- Some unit tests.
