This module is a reimplementation of dynamicjava.org's api-bridge.  Differences:

- Optimized for passing the same objects back and forth across the membrane
  between the primary classloader and the OSGi environment with the same bridge
  (Membrane) instance.  Will create at most one proxy per object.
- Uses cglib 2.1.3 instead of 1.0 for compatibility with Hibernate & Spring.
- Ignores classes from the bootstrap classloader.
- Bridges thrown exceptions.
- Has more robust selection of superclasses for proxying: by default, only selects
  superclasses with a default constructor.  Allows for configurable default
  default constructor parameters on a per-class basis.
- Has more robust invocation of delegate methods: invokes the method from the
  implemented interface or java.lang.Object instead of from the class directly
  where applicable.  This allows compatibility with, e.g., private inner classes.
- Supports for proxying the contents of java.util.Collections.
- Some unit tests.
