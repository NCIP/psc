This directory contains standard external libraries which were wrapped using 
bnd to make them compatible with PSC's OSGi layer.  If you need to change the
way one is wrapped:

- Change the bnd properties passed to psc_osgi_artifact for the artifact
  in question.
- Delete the relevant jar file in this directory.
- Run `buildr artifacts` (or anything that depends on the artifact in question).
- If the new jar is as you expect it, add the new jar to the 
  VCS and commit.

See tasks/psc-osgi-artifact.rake for the mechanism.
